# SUPABASE BACKUP RESTORATION GUIDE
Generated: 2025-09-01 23:54:55
Environment: Production (evxrzmzkghshjmmyegxu)

## Prerequisites
- Supabase CLI installed and configured
- Access to the target Supabase project
- Docker Desktop running (for local development)

## Files in this backup:
- `schema.sql`: Complete database schema (tables, functions, triggers, policies)
- `data.sql`: All table data from public schema
- `auth_schema.sql`: Auth schema including users table
- `backup_info.json`: Backup metadata
- `restore_instructions.md`: This file

## Restoration Steps

### 1. For Local Development
\`\`\`bash
# Start Supabase locally
supabase start

# Reset local database
supabase db reset

# Apply schema
psql -h localhost -p 54322 -U postgres -d postgres -f schema.sql

# Apply data
psql -h localhost -p 54322 -U postgres -d postgres -f data.sql

# Apply auth schema (if needed)
psql -h localhost -p 54322 -U postgres -d postgres -f auth_schema.sql
\`\`\`

### 2. For Remote Project
\`\`\`bash
# Link to your project
supabase link --project-ref YOUR_PROJECT_REF

# Push schema changes
supabase db push

# For data restoration, use Supabase Studio SQL editor
# Copy and paste the contents of data.sql
\`\`\`

### 3. Verification Steps
- Check that all tables exist: `\dt` in psql
- Verify user data is present: `SELECT count(*) FROM auth.users;`
- Test authentication flows
- Confirm all functions and triggers work
- Verify RLS policies are active

## Important Notes
1. This backup preserves the auth.users table which is managed by Supabase
2. Custom tables and their data are included
3. Functions, triggers, and policies are included
4. Storage buckets configuration may need manual setup
5. Environment variables need to be configured separately

## Troubleshooting
If restoration fails:
1. Check Supabase CLI version compatibility
2. Ensure target project is clean
3. Verify network connectivity
4. Check for permission issues
5. Review Supabase logs for errors

## Next Steps After Restoration
1. Test all authentication flows
2. Verify all users can login
3. Check that all data is accessible
4. Proceed with auth refactor implementation

## Support
For issues with this backup, refer to:
- Supabase documentation: https://supabase.com/docs
- Auth refactor requirements document
- Auth refactor design document
