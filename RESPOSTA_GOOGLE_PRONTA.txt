Hello Google Developer Team,

Thank you for reviewing our application. We have addressed all the issues highlighted in your review:

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. JUSTIFICATION FOR OAUTH SCOPES

We require the `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar` scope exclusively to create mentorship session events in Google Calendar when a mentor confirms a session with a mentee.

SPECIFIC USE CASE:
Menvo is a volunteer mentorship platform that connects mentors with mentees for free professional guidance sessions. When a mentorship session is confirmed by the mentor, our application:

• Automatically creates a calendar event with session details (date, time, duration, title, description)
• Sends calendar invitations to both mentor and mentee via email
• Generates a Google Meet link for the video call session
• Adds the event to both participants' Google Calendars with automatic reminders

WHAT WE DO NOT DO:
• We do NOT access, read, or modify any other calendar events
• We do NOT store calendar data on our servers beyond the event creation
• We do NOT share calendar data with any third parties
• We do NOT use calendar data for any purpose other than creating mentorship events

WHY THIS SCOPE IS NECESSARY:
The `calendar` scope is the minimum required to create calendar events and send invitations to participants. Without this scope, we cannot provide this essential functionality, and users would need to manually create calendar events for each mentorship session, significantly degrading the user experience and reducing the effectiveness of our mentorship platform.

2. OAUTH CONSENT SCREEN WORKFLOW VIDEO

Demo video URL: [ADICIONE SEU LINK DO YOUTUBE AQUI]

The video demonstrates the complete OAuth workflow:
• User logging into the Menvo platform
• Navigating to the mentorship scheduling page
• Selecting a mentor and available time slot
• Mentor confirming the mentorship session
• OAuth consent screen appearing with clearly visible requested scopes
• User reviewing and authorizing the access
• Calendar event being created successfully in Google Calendar
• Invitations sent to both mentor and mentee
• Event visible in both participants' calendars with Google Meet link

The video clearly shows the OAuth consent screen with the requested scopes and the user granting permission.
