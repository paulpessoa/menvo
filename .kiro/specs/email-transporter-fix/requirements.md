# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Fix the build error in the migration notifications system caused by incorrect Nodemailer transporter configuration. The error "d.createTransporter is not a function" occurs because the code uses `nodemailer.createTransporter` instead of the correct `nodemailer.createTransport` method.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the build process to complete successfully, so that the application can be deployed without errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the build process runs THEN the system SHALL compile without "createTransporter is not a function" errors
2. WHEN the migration notifications module is imported THEN the system SHALL use the correct Nodemailer API method
3. WHEN the email transporter is initialized THEN the system SHALL create a valid SMTP transport instance

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want the migration notification system to work correctly, so that migrated users receive their login credentials via email.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the send-migration-notifications API is called THEN the system SHALL successfully send emails using the corrected transporter
2. WHEN the email configuration is loaded THEN the system SHALL use proper environment variables for SMTP settings
3. WHEN emails are sent in batch THEN the system SHALL handle the transporter correctly without runtime errors

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error handling and validation, so that email failures are handled gracefully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the SMTP configuration is invalid THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages
2. WHEN email sending fails THEN the system SHALL log appropriate error details
3. WHEN the transporter initialization fails THEN the system SHALL handle the error without crashing the build
