# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Analyze and categorize all existing scripts


  - Create inventory of all 45+ scripts with their purpose and usage
  - Identify scripts referenced in package.json, code, and documentation
  - Map dependencies between scripts and external references
  - Classify scripts into categories: setup, database, testing, validation, maintenance, docs
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.1_



- [ ] 2. Create new folder structure and move essential scripts
  - Create subdirectories: setup/, database/, testing/, validation/, maintenance/, docs/
  - Move actively used scripts to appropriate folders (migrate-users.js, setup-admin-and-mentors.js, etc.)
  - Update package.json npm scripts to reflect new paths


  - Update any code references to moved script files
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4_

- [ ] 3. Identify and remove redundant/unused scripts
  - Remove duplicate setup scripts (setup-users-simple.js, setup-users-direct.js if redundant)


  - Remove outdated or unused test scripts that have no unique functionality
  - Remove any scripts that are no longer relevant to current system
  - Document removed scripts in case rollback is needed
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3_



- [ ] 4. Consolidate similar scripts and functionality
  - Merge similar setup scripts into comprehensive versions with options
  - Consolidate overlapping test scripts while preserving unique functionality
  - Combine related SQL files into organized database/sql/ subfolder
  - Ensure consolidated scripts handle all use cases from original scripts
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4_

- [ ] 5. Add consistent documentation and headers to all scripts
  - Add standardized headers to all remaining scripts with purpose, usage, and dependencies
  - Create comprehensive scripts/README.md with categorized script descriptions
  - Move and organize all .md documentation files into scripts/docs/ folder
  - Add usage examples and environment requirements for each script category
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4_

- [ ] 6. Update all references and test functionality
  - Update any remaining file references in codebase to new script locations
  - Test all npm scripts to ensure they work with new file paths
  - Verify essential development workflows (user setup, database operations, OAuth validation)
  - Test script execution in clean environment to ensure no broken dependencies
  - _Requirements: 1.4, 2.3, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4_

- [ ] 7. Final verification and cleanup
  - Run full test of all essential scripts to ensure no regressions
  - Verify all documentation is accurate and up-to-date
  - Check that folder structure is clean and logical
  - Create backup of original structure for rollback if needed
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4_
