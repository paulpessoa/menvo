# Common Domain Component Detection

This skill identifies common domain functionality that is duplicated across multiple components and suggests consolidation opportunities to reduce duplication and improve maintainability.

## How to Use

### Quick Start

Request analysis of your codebase:

- **"Find common domain functionality across components"**
- **"Identify duplicate domain logic that should be consolidated"**
- **"Detect shared classes used across multiple components"**
- **"Analyze consolidation opportunities for common components"**

### Usage Examples

**Example 1: Find Common Functionality**

```
User: "Find common domain functionality across components"

The skill will:
1. Scan component namespaces for common patterns
2. Detect shared classes used across components
3. Identify duplicate domain logic
4. Analyze coupling impact of consolidation
5. Suggest consolidation opportunities
```

**Example 2: Detect Duplicate Notification Logic**

```
User: "Are there multiple notification components that should be consolidated?"

The skill will:
1. Find all components with notification-related names
2. Analyze their functionality and dependencies
3. Calculate coupling impact if consolidated
4. Recommend consolidation approach
```

**Example 3: Analyze Shared Classes**

```
User: "Find classes that are shared across multiple components"

The skill will:
1. Identify classes imported/used by multiple components
2. Classify as domain vs infrastructure functionality
3. Suggest consolidation or shared library approach
4. Assess impact on coupling
```

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Scan Components**: Identify components with common namespace patterns
2. **Detect Shared Code**: Find classes/files used across components
3. **Analyze Functionality**: Determine if functionality is truly common
4. **Assess Coupling**: Calculate coupling impact before consolidation
5. **Recommend Actions**: Suggest consolidation or shared library approach

## When to Use

Apply this skill when:

- After identifying and sizing components (Pattern 1)
- Before flattening components (Pattern 3)
- When planning to reduce code duplication
- Analyzing shared domain logic across the codebase
- Preparing for component consolidation
- Identifying candidates for shared services or libraries

## Core Concepts

### Domain vs Infrastructure Functionality

**Domain Functionality** (candidates for consolidation):

- Business processing logic (notification, validation, auditing, formatting)
- Common to **some** processes, not all
- Examples: Customer notification, ticket auditing, data validation

**Infrastructure Functionality** (usually not consolidated here):

- Operational concerns (logging, metrics, security)
- Common to **all** processes
- Examples: Logging, authentication, database connections

### Common Domain Patterns

Common domain functionality often appears as:

1. **Namespace Patterns**: Components ending in same leaf node
   - `*.notification`, `*.audit`, `*.validation`, `*.formatting`
   - Example: `TicketNotification`, `BillingNotification`, `SurveyNotification`

2. **Shared Classes**: Same class used across multiple components
   - Example: `SMTPConnection` used by 5 different components
   - Example: `AuditLogger` used by multiple domain components

3. **Similar Functionality**: Different components doing similar things
   - Example: Multiple components sending emails with slight variations
   - Example: Multiple components writing audit logs

### Consolidation Approaches

**Shared Service**:

- Common functionality becomes a separate service
- Other components call this service
- Good for: Frequently changing logic, complex operations

**Shared Library**:

- Common code packaged as library (JAR, DLL, npm package)
- Components import and use the library
- Good for: Stable functionality, simple utilities

**Component Consolidation**:

- Merge multiple components into one
- Good for: Highly related functionality, low coupling impact

## Analysis Process

### Phase 1: Identify Common Namespace Patterns

Scan component namespaces for common leaf node names:

1. **Extract leaf nodes** from all component namespaces
   - Example: `services/billing/notification` → `notification`
   - Example: `services/ticket/notification` → `notification`

2. **Group by common leaf nodes**
   - Find components with same leaf node name
   - Example: All components ending in `.notification`

3. **Filter out infrastructure patterns**
   - Exclude: `.util`, `.helper`, `.common` (usually infrastructure)
   - Focus on: `.notification`, `.audit`, `.validation`, `.formatting`

**Example Output**:

```markdown
## Common Namespace Patterns Found

**Notification Components**:

- services/customer/notification
- services/ticket/notification
- services/survey/notification

**Audit Components**:

- services/billing/audit
- services/ticket/audit
- services/survey/audit
```

### Phase 2: Detect Shared Classes

Find classes/files used across multiple components:

1. **Scan imports/dependencies** in each component
   - Track which classes are imported from where
   - Note classes used by multiple components

2. **Identify shared classes**
   - Classes imported by 2+ components
   - Exclude infrastructure classes (Logger, Config, etc.)

3. **Classify as domain vs infrastructure**
   - Domain: Business logic classes (SMTPConnection, AuditLogger)
   - Infrastructure: Technical utilities (Logger, DatabaseConnection)

**Example Output**:

```markdown
## Shared Classes Found

**Domain Classes**:

- `SMTPConnection` - Used by 5 components (notification-related)
- `AuditLogger` - Used by 8 components (audit-related)
- `DataFormatter` - Used by 3 components (formatting-related)

**Infrastructure Classes** (exclude from consolidation):

- `Logger` - Used by all components (infrastructure)
- `Config` - Used by all components (infrastructure)
```

### Phase 3: Analyze Functionality Similarity

For each group of common components:

1. **Examine functionality**
   - Read source code of each component
   - Identify what each component does
   - Note similarities and differences

2. **Assess consolidation feasibility**
   - Are differences minor (configurable)?
   - Can differences be abstracted?
   - Is functionality truly the same?

3. **Calculate coupling impact**
   - Count incoming dependencies (afferent coupling) before consolidation
   - Estimate incoming dependencies after consolidation
   - Compare total coupling levels

**Example Analysis**:

```markdown
## Functionality Analysis

**Notification Components**:

- CustomerNotification: Sends billing notifications
- TicketNotification: Sends ticket assignment notifications
- SurveyNotification: Sends survey emails

**Similarities**: All send emails to customers
**Differences**: Email content/templates, triggers

**Consolidation Feasibility**: ✅ High

- Differences are in content, not mechanism
- Can be abstracted with templates/context
```

### Phase 4: Assess Coupling Impact

Before recommending consolidation, analyze coupling:

1. **Calculate current coupling**
   - Count components using each notification component
   - Sum total incoming dependencies

2. **Estimate consolidated coupling**
   - Count components that would use consolidated component
   - Compare to current total

3. **Evaluate coupling increase**
   - Is consolidated component too coupled?
   - Does it create a bottleneck?
   - Is coupling increase acceptable?

**Example Coupling Analysis**:

```markdown
## Coupling Impact Analysis

**Before Consolidation**:

- CustomerNotification: Used by 2 components (CA = 2)
- TicketNotification: Used by 2 components (CA = 2)
- SurveyNotification: Used by 1 component (CA = 1)
- **Total CA**: 5

**After Consolidation**:

- Notification: Used by 5 components (CA = 5)
- **Total CA**: 5 (same!)

**Verdict**: ✅ No coupling increase, safe to consolidate
```

### Phase 5: Recommend Consolidation Approach

Based on analysis, recommend approach:

**Shared Service** (if):

- Functionality changes frequently
- Complex operations
- Needs independent scaling
- Multiple deployment units will use it

**Shared Library** (if):

- Stable functionality
- Simple utilities
- Compile-time dependency acceptable
- No need for independent deployment

**Component Consolidation** (if):

- Highly related functionality
- Low coupling impact
- Same deployment unit acceptable

## Implementation Notes

### For Node.js/Express Applications

Common patterns to look for:

```
services/
├── CustomerService/
│   └── notification.js      ← Common pattern
├── TicketService/
│   └── notification.js     ← Common pattern
└── SurveyService/
    └── notification.js      ← Common pattern
```

**Shared Classes**:

- Check `require()` statements
- Look for classes imported from other components
- Example: `const SMTPConnection = require('../shared/SMTPConnection')`

### For Java Applications

Common patterns:

```
com.company.billing.audit     ← Common pattern
com.company.ticket.audit      ← Common pattern
com.company.survey.audit      ← Common pattern
```

**Shared Classes**:

- Check `import` statements
- Look for classes in common packages
- Example: `import com.company.shared.AuditLogger`

### Detection Strategies

**Namespace Pattern Detection**:

```javascript
// Extract leaf nodes from namespaces
function extractLeafNode(namespace) {
  const parts = namespace.split('/')
  return parts[parts.length - 1]
}

// Group by common leaf nodes
function groupByLeafNode(components) {
  const groups = {}
  components.forEach((comp) => {
    const leaf = extractLeafNode(comp.namespace)
    if (!groups[leaf]) groups[leaf] = []
    groups[leaf].push(comp)
  })
  return groups
}
```

**Shared Class Detection**:

```javascript
// Find classes used by multiple components
function findSharedClasses(components) {
  const classUsage = {}
  components.forEach((comp) => {
    comp.imports.forEach((imp) => {
      if (!classUsage[imp]) classUsage[imp] = []
      classUsage[imp].push(comp.name)
    })
  })

  return Object.entries(classUsage)
    .filter(([cls, users]) => users.length > 1)
    .map(([cls, users]) => ({ class: cls, usedBy: users }))
}
```

## Fitness Functions

After identifying common components, create automated checks:

### Common Namespace Pattern Detection

```javascript
// Alert if new components with common patterns are created
function checkCommonPatterns(components, exclusionList = []) {
  const leafNodes = {}
  components.forEach((comp) => {
    const leaf = extractLeafNode(comp.namespace)
    if (!exclusionList.includes(leaf)) {
      if (!leafNodes[leaf]) leafNodes[leaf] = []
      leafNodes[leaf].push(comp.name)
    }
  })

  return Object.entries(leafNodes)
    .filter(([leaf, comps]) => comps.length > 1)
    .map(([leaf, comps]) => ({
      pattern: leaf,
      components: comps,
      suggestion: 'Consider consolidating these components',
    }))
}
```

### Shared Class Usage Alert

```javascript
// Alert if class is used by multiple components
function checkSharedClasses(components, exclusionList = []) {
  const classUsage = {}
  components.forEach((comp) => {
    comp.imports.forEach((imp) => {
      if (!exclusionList.includes(imp)) {
        if (!classUsage[imp]) classUsage[imp] = []
        classUsage[imp].push(comp.name)
      }
    })
  })

  return Object.entries(classUsage)
    .filter(([cls, users]) => users.length > 1)
    .map(([cls, users]) => ({
      class: cls,
      usedBy: users,
      suggestion: 'Consider extracting to shared component or library',
    }))
}
```

## Best Practices

### Do's ✅

- Distinguish domain from infrastructure functionality
- Analyze coupling impact before consolidating
- Consider both shared service and shared library approaches
- Look for namespace patterns AND shared classes
- Verify functionality is truly similar before consolidating
- Calculate coupling metrics (CA) before and after

### Don'ts ❌

- Don't consolidate infrastructure functionality (handled separately)
- Don't consolidate without analyzing coupling impact
- Don't assume all common patterns should be consolidated
- Don't ignore differences in functionality
- Don't consolidate if coupling increase is too high
- Don't mix domain and infrastructure in same analysis

## Common Patterns to Look For

### High Consolidation Candidates

- **Notification**: `*.notification`, `*.notify`, `*.email`
- **Audit**: `*.audit`, `*.auditing`, `*.log`
- **Validation**: `*.validation`, `*.validate`, `*.validator`
- **Formatting**: `*.format`, `*.formatter`, `*.formatting`
- **Reporting**: `*.report`, `*.reporting` (if similar functionality)

### Low Consolidation Candidates

- **Infrastructure**: `*.util`, `*.helper`, `*.common` (usually infrastructure)
- **Different contexts**: Same name, different business meaning
- **High coupling risk**: Consolidation would create bottleneck

## Next Steps

After identifying common domain components:

1. **Apply Flatten Components Pattern** - Remove orphaned classes
2. **Apply Determine Component Dependencies Pattern** - Analyze coupling
3. **Create Component Domains** - Group components into domains
4. **Plan Consolidation** - Execute consolidation recommendations

## Notes

- Common domain functionality is different from infrastructure functionality
- Consolidation reduces duplication but may increase coupling
- Always analyze coupling impact before consolidating
- Shared services vs shared libraries have different trade-offs
- Some duplication is acceptable if it reduces coupling
- Not all common patterns should be consolidated
