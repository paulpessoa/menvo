# Task 5 Implementation Summary: Seleção Obrigatória de Papel

## Overview
Successfully implemented mandatory role selection for authenticated users without assigned roles, ensuring proper flow from registration/login to role-specific dashboards.

## Subtask 5.1: Criar página de seleção de papel ✅

### Created Components
1. **`/app/auth/select-role/page.tsx`**
   - Clean, user-friendly interface for role selection
   - Two role options: Mentor and Mentee with clear descriptions
   - Visual feedback during selection process
   - Uses auth context `selectRole()` method
   - Proper error handling and loading states
   - Automatic redirect based on selected role

2. **Role-Specific Dashboards**
   - **`/app/dashboard/mentor/page.tsx`**: Mentor-specific dashboard with verification status
   - **`/app/dashboard/mentee/page.tsx`**: Mentee-focused dashboard with mentor discovery
   - **`/app/dashboard/admin/page.tsx`**: Admin dashboard with management tools
   - **Updated `/app/dashboard/page.tsx`**: Smart redirector to role-specific dashboards

### Key Features Implemented
- **Clear Role Descriptions**: Each role has benefits and clear explanations
- **Visual Selection**: Interactive cards with selection indicators
- **Validation**: Prevents submission without role selection
- **Loading States**: Visual feedback during role assignment
- **Error Handling**: Proper error messages and retry capability

## Subtask 5.2: Implementar lógica de redirecionamento baseada em papel ✅

### AuthGuard Integration
- **Automatic Redirection**: Users without roles are redirected to `/auth/select-role`
- **Role Verification**: Checks user roles before allowing access to protected pages
- **Verification Status**: Handles mentor verification requirements
- **Fallback Components**: Graceful handling of access denied scenarios

### Callback Route Integration
- **OAuth Flow**: After OAuth login, checks for role and redirects appropriately
- **Email Confirmation**: New users redirected to role selection after email confirmation
- **Existing Users**: Users with roles redirected to dashboard

### Dashboard Flow
- **Smart Routing**: Main dashboard detects user role and redirects to specific dashboard
- **Role-Specific Content**: Each dashboard shows relevant information for that role
- **Verification Awareness**: Mentor dashboard shows verification status

## Technical Implementation Details

### Database Integration
- Uses new simplified schema with `user_roles` table
- Properly creates role assignments via `selectRole()` method
- Updates JWT custom claims for immediate role availability
- Maintains referential integrity with cascade deletes

### Auth Context Usage
- Leverages existing `selectRole()` method from auth context
- Proper error handling with `handleAuthError()` helper
- Automatic profile refresh after role selection
- Loading state management

### User Experience
- **Seamless Flow**: Registration → Confirmation → Role Selection → Dashboard
- **Clear Feedback**: Users always know their current status
- **Responsive Design**: Works on all device sizes
- **Accessibility**: Proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation

## Flow Verification

### Complete User Journey
1. **Registration**: User registers via email or OAuth
2. **Confirmation**: Email confirmation (if needed)
3. **Role Selection**: Mandatory role selection with clear options
4. **Dashboard Access**: Automatic redirect to appropriate dashboard
5. **Protected Pages**: All protected pages respect role requirements

### Edge Cases Handled
- Users trying to access protected pages without roles
- Users with existing roles accessing role selection page
- Network errors during role selection
- Invalid role selection attempts
- Unauthenticated access attempts

## Requirements Compliance

### Requirement 6.1 ✅
- Users with null role are redirected to role selection page
- Redirection works from any protected page access

### Requirement 6.2 ✅
- Role selection page offers only "mentor" and "mentee" options
- Clear descriptions and benefits for each role

### Requirement 6.3 ✅
- Role selection updates `user_roles` table correctly
- Uses proper database relationships and constraints

### Requirement 6.4 ✅
- Users cannot access other pages without selecting a role
- AuthGuard enforces role requirement consistently

### Requirement 6.5 ✅
- After role selection, users are redirected to appropriate dashboards
- Dashboard content is role-specific and relevant

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing
- Test complete registration → role selection → dashboard flow
- Verify OAuth and email registration paths
- Test protected page access without roles
- Verify role-specific dashboard content

### Automated Testing
- Unit tests for role selection component
- Integration tests for auth flow
- E2E tests for complete user journey

## Future Enhancements

### Phase 2 Considerations
- Role change functionality (if needed)
- Multiple role support (if required)
- Role-based feature flags
- Advanced role permissions

## Files Modified/Created

### New Files
- `app/auth/select-role/page.tsx`
- `app/dashboard/mentor/page.tsx`
- `app/dashboard/mentee/page.tsx`
- `app/dashboard/admin/page.tsx`
- `tests/auth-role-selection.test.md`
- `docs/task-5-implementation-summary.md`

### Modified Files
- `app/dashboard/page.tsx` (updated to redirect based on role)

### Existing Files Used
- `lib/auth/auth-context.tsx` (selectRole method)
- `lib/auth/use-auth.ts` (helper methods)
- `lib/auth/auth-guard.tsx` (role verification)
- `app/auth/callback/route.ts` (already had role checking)

## Conclusion

Task 5 has been successfully implemented with a complete role selection system that ensures all users have assigned roles before accessing the platform. The implementation follows the requirements exactly and provides a smooth, user-friendly experience while maintaining security and data integrity.
