-- 8. VERIFICATION QUERIES
-- =====================================================

-- Query to verify triggers are created
SELECT 
    trigger_name,
    event_manipulation,
    event_object_table,
    action_timing,
    action_statement
FROM information_schema.triggers 
WHERE trigger_name LIKE '%auth_user_deleted%'

-- Query to verify functions are created
SELECT 
    routine_name,

    data_type

-- =====================================================
-- USAGE NOTES:
-- =====================================================
-- 1. These triggers will automatically fire when a user is deleted from auth.users
-- 2. All related data will be cleaned up in the correct order
-- 3. Logging is included for audit purposes
-- 4. Triggers are created with SECURITY DEFINER to ensure proper permissions
-- 5. Error handling is included to prevent cascade failures
-- 6. To test: DELETE FROM auth.users WHERE id = 'test-user-id';
-- 7. To disable: DROP TRIGGER trigger_name ON auth.users;
-- 8. To re-enable: Run the CREATE TRIGGER statements again
